# SMS_Spam_Detection_using_NLP
# Problem Statement:
Mobile message is a way of communication among the people, and billions of mobile device users exchange numerous messages. However, such type of communication is insecure due to lack of proper message filtering mechanisms. One cause of such insecurity is spam and The spam detection is a big issue in mobile message communication due to which mobile message communication is insecure. In order to tackle this problem, an accurate and precise method is needed to detect the spam in mobile message communication. Our job is to create a model which predicts whether a given SMS is spam or ham.
